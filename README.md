## Python Projects

**1. Cleaning Patients data** 
* [Code](https://github.com/Mansi242401/Data_Wrangling/tree/main) <br>

**2. Exploratory Data Analysis - Movies Data**
* [Code](https://github.com/Mansi242401/EDA_movies) <br>

**3. Data Wrangling and Transformation** <br>

In this project I have used financial data set which includes Balance Sheet and P&L Components of 29 companies. The data is in Json-like format in a text file and is required to be converted into tabular data in a google spreadhseet. Here is a [link](https://github.com/Mansi242401/text_df_googlesheet/tree/main) to the complete project with step-by-step execution.
